This is a PLC project, programmed with Tia Portal Siemens software, which was developed for a bean plant automation.
I programmed a PLC 1214 and a HMI KTP700. There were about 15 motors. Command, states sensors visualization,
alarms management related to electrical protection devices, and users credentials were programmed and included in the HMI. 
Language used were: SCL, STL and ladder. Block functions and classes were implemented in the software.
